# Predictions-for-patients-status
This is my Msc Project

About this project:
------------------------------------------
The objective of this project is to design useful algorithms which can detect if the injured ankle of orthopaedic is higher than the heart by only using one IMU attached to the injured ankle. There are two sorts of different results. The first one is the prediction whether the patient put his injured ankle higher than his heart in each time, which can make the doctors know the actions of patients. Therefore, SVM and RNN were used to make the predictions in this project. 

The project contains the steps of data collection, signal processing, algorithm design, programming and result analysis. All the resources in each step which needs coding have been uploaded here.

About the codes:
-------------------------------------------
The original data in the step of data collection have been uploaded into the file "original data".
